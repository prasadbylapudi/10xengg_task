The Library Application is a web-based platform that allows users to explore and discover a collection of books. Users can search for books, apply filters based on authors, genres, and publishers, and view book details through an interactive user interface.

## Features

- Search for books by title, author, genre, publisher, or description.
- Apply filters to narrow search results based on authors, genres, and publishers.
- View detailed information about each book, including the cover image, author, genre, publisher, description, and price.
- For Cover Images, I have used the Unsplash random API which gives random images.


## Technologies Used

- React:  A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Material-UI: A popular UI framework for React applications.
- CSS: Styling and layout of the application.
- Unit Testing: Jest and React Testing Library for testing components and functionalities.
